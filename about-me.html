    <h1>This is all about me</h1>
    <p>I was born December 8th, 2006. My mom says that I was her miracle and that I would be destined for greatness. My uncle who was in high school at the time had to go to a meeting for school for him to graduate.To this day he still bothers me about it and jokes around about it. My moms water broke before he was able to go to that meeting and he called my cousin who then drove over the brooklyn bridge to the hospital with a police escort. I am from a very diverse background. My dad is Filipino and Puerto Rican. My mom's family is from St Lucia and India. I grew up in brooklyn then in elmhurst queens where I spent pre-k and kindegarten. After that I came backk to brooklyn where I finished the rest of my grade out here. Even though I moved around a lot it didn't stop me from doing extra curricular activities. Throughout me growing up I was always occupied with an extra curricular like Piano, football, soccer, or guitar. My interest are computer science, clothes, and sketching on my freetime or when I am bored.</p>
