    <h1>This is all about me</h1>
    <p>I was born December 8th, 2006. My mom says that I was her miracle and that I would be destined for greatness. My uncle who was in high school at the time had to go to a meeting for school(to this day he still bothers me about it). Then, my moms water broke and he called my cousin who then drove over the brooklyn bridge to the hospital with a police escort. I am from a very diverse background. My dad is Filipino and Puerto Rican. My mom's family is from St Lucia and India. Throughout me growing up I was always occupied with an extra curricular like Piano, football, soccer, or guitar.  </p>
